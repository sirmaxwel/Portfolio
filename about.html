                    <h1>Hello, thank you for visiting my site!</h1>
                    <p>I received my BA from The New School for Public Engagement with the focus on Media and Culture.
                        Before attending High school and University in the United States, I grew up in Munich, Germany and Oxford, England speaking both German and English with native fluency. 
                        Attending International Schools and living in different continents has helped me become a strong communicator as I was continuously forced to adapt to many different situations.
                        I am a quick learner who can rapidly adapt to changing situations, while utilizing my knowledge.
                        On my spare time I enjoy walking my dog, spending time exploring new areas. If its not hiking, you can find me on a sailboat.
                        Currently I am teaching myself how to code HTML5, CSS and Javascript with the end goal of having a solid understanding of front-end web development.</p>
